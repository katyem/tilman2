# rAIG

The plan is to build a version of the KOTA that will build stimulus images using R. It will have some degree of flexibility regarding the number of stimuli presented. This will allow for configuration of KOTA, Shepard-Metzler, Matrices, etc.

I'll polulate the github repository once I get coding on the project.
