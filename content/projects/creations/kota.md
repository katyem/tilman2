The KOTA represents my second attempt at Automated Item Generation. My first experience with it was working with [Scotty Hines](https://twitter.com/scottyhines) on a very interesting number analogy test. This time around I wanted to use graphic images. I was greatly influenced by the [iCar project](https://icar-project.com/) which seemed to be mostly dormant by the time I stumbled upon it. The plan is to rewrite the code that builds the item images in r for use in our rAIG project's open assessment system. 

Feel free to take it for a spin: [the KOTA at Katyem.net](https://katyem.net)
